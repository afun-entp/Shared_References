# What is a Tome?
These are the digital equivalent of the trusty notebook.
They represent my collective experience; the tricks, techniques, and syntaxes for various systems and languages.

My Tome files are the closest thing I've found to an experience bar and talent tree in real life.

The name calls to mind old handwritten leather bound volumes belonging to scholars, 18th century scientists, philosophers, and other madman. It evokes a bit of science, and fiction, and RPG.
